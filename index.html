            <h2>Amazon Solutions Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you’re wanting to go serverless to cut costs and increase availability or just need to optimize your current business processes using the latest cloud computing technologies, AWS offers solutions to design and deploy dynamically scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant, and reliable applications. To fully take advantage of all AWS can offer, you need a Solutions Architect like myself to take the reigns and hand-select the appropriate AWS services to design and deploy an application, or even enterprise-wide scalable operations, based on your business’s requirements. If you’re not already on AWS, I can migrate complex, multi-tier applications to AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest advantage of having a Solutions Architect like myself on your side is my ability to implement cost-control strategies. For example, this website you are looking at now is not being served not from an actual server, but an Amazon S3 bucket, for free - giving me super low cost and scalability that GoDaddy or other low-end and outdated server standards cannot offer. If I were to incorporate Lambda functions into this website’s architecture, I could have a site that does practically anything, at a cost of cents per month. If this sounds interesting to you, and you want hassle-free, low-cost web hosting, I currently operate a <a href="https://www.handsomecathosting.com" title="Handsome Cat Hosting" target="_blank">boutique hosting company</a> that focuses on this niche.

            <h2>Frontend & Backend Development</h2>
            <p>
                I first started out in website development as a frontend designer and developer, with a passion for design and the goal to master backend development as well as frontend. I learned from job postings that this made me what is called a “unicorn”, because experts in both frontend and backend are as elusive as unicorns. My skill set grew from frontend mastery to navigating within PHP and Linux servers, using PHP as my main programming language. As a lifelong learner and professional developer, I went on to conquer <span class="italic">Object Oriented Programming</span> with PHP, creating even more value for my valued clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to work on projects that allow for proper <span class="italic">test driven development</span> and a focus on the <span class="italic">quality of code</span>. I find that high quality code not only creates better projects, it also creates better business relationships as the projects grow.  After over 15 years in the business, I crave the large scale and complex projects that create long-term client relationships. Such large scale projects include custom Content Management System (CMS) development, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) development, and API development (whether custom creation from scratch is needed, or integrating existing third party APIs like Salesforce, MailChimp, iContact, etc. is preferred).

            <h2>Enterprise Level Mobile App Development</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoy building mobile applications companies seeking <span class="italic">enterprise level</span> mobile and tablet applications for to help automate business operations. I offer the ability to create the mobile phone app, hybrid app, and build the custom API to introduce the strong foundation for an app to scale in use. I've created apps to help companies manage sales flows with their sales and management teams, logistics automation and tracking, social networking and media companies, and passion projects for entrepreneurs across the planet. I've released custom mobile and tablet applications in the Construction, Healthcare, Logistitcs, and Financial spaces for over 7 years.

            <p>
                I have worked extensively with WordPress as a base CMS for my projects since it <span class="italic">literally first came out</span>, and have released over 300+ successful user experiences for brands across the Healthcare, Entertainment, Enterprise, and Financial sectors. I focus on super-custom WordPress themes and plugins to help companies increase automation, processes, and to leverage their site with better security practices. I still think it is the best CMS solution for a client, and comfortable with it for both large and Enterprise-level applications.

            <p>
                I started out over 10 years ago, working directly with ad agencies on both coasts taking designs and turning them into <span class="strong">pixel perfect</span> html/css/sass frontend representations of .PSD mockups. I have an eye for design, and the ability to strive for perfection with chosen designs on the various number of platforms your audience are using. I also enjoy walking a client through a new site design process without chosen mockups, instead opting for <span class="italic">an orangic approach</span> to creating a stunning website.
