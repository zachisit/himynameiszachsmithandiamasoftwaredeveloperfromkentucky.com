            <h2>Amazon Solutions Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you’re wanting to go serverless to cut costs and increase availability, or need to optimize your current business processes using the latest cloud computing technologies, I am able to offer solutions through AWS to design and deploy dynamically scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant, and reliable applications. To fully take advantage of all AWS can offer, you need a <span class="italic">Solutions Architect like myself</span> to take the reigns and hand-select the appropriate AWS services to design and deploy an application or enterprise-wide scalable operation, based on your business’s requirements. If you’re not already on AWS, I can migrate complex, multi-tier applications to AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest advantage of having a Solutions Architect like myself on your side is my ability to implement cost-control strategies. For example, this website you are looking at now is not being served from a server instance, but an Amazon S3 bucket, for free - giving me super low cost and scalability that GoDaddy and other low-end, outdated server standards cannot offer. If I were to incorporate Lambda functions into this website’s architecture, I could have a site that does practically anything, at a cost of cents per month. AWS offers myriad ways to optimize technical business processes and cut costs, and as an <span class="italic">AWS Architect</span>, I know how to navigate and exploit all of them.

            <h2>Software Development Manager</h2>
            <p>
                Having been a Software Developer for more than 15 years, I know that most developers don’t quit jobs - <span class="italic">they quit bosses</span>. A team of Software Developers needs a leader, not just in technological skills, but in coordination, organization, and motivation. Being a highly skilled Software Developer speaks volumes to my technical and problem solving expertise, yet I know that to guarantee success as a Software Development Manager, leadership, communication, budgeting, and time management are just as essential. Utilizing Scrum and DevOps practices in an Agile environment, I can ensure my team not only flourishes independently, but that it incorporates itself elegantly within the business as a whole, in unity with all departments necessary to achieve goals and pursue greater heights. When a business is in harmony, <span class="italic">employees stick around</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                An integral part of being a Software Development Manager is navigating a delicate balance between being a Manager and a Developer. I like to follow the 80-20 rule, representing that 80% of my efforts are focused on management processes and 20% of my time is dedicated to studying the cutting edge of technological advancements in Software Development. This way, <span class="italic">I am perpetually a value to my clients</span> as both an expert Software Developer, and a Software Development Manager that can train my team’s technical standards on pace with the ever-evolving, fast-paced world of development. I’ve managed a diverse range of Software Developers throughout my career and my success has been in knowing that all of these skills I possess need to integrate seamlessly in order to orchestrate a happy and productive team, consistently driving the accelerated success of the respective business.
