            <h2>Advanced PHP & Frontend Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I first started out in website development as a frontend designer and developer, with a passion for design and technology. I soon became interested in the backend sides of the projects, specially with PHP and Linux servers. My main programming language is PHP, and within the last few years I've successfully pivoted to <span class="italic">Object Oriented Programming</span> with PHP. I like to work on projects that allow for proper <span class="italic">test driven development</span> and a focus for the love and quality of code. I find that good code creates better projects and <span class="italic">better client relationships</span> as the projects grow. Such large scale projects include API development (both custom from scratch and using existing third party APIs like Salesforce, MailChimp, iContact, and others), custom Content Management System and Customer Relationship Management systems. At this point in my career I crave the large scale and complex projects that create a long term application.

            <h2>Enterprise Level Mobile App Development</h2>
            <p>
                I really enjoy building mobile applications companies seeking <span class="italic">enterprise level</span> mobile and tablet applications for to help automate business operations. I offer the ability to create the mobile phone app, hybrid app, and build the custom API to introduce the strong foundation for an app to scale in use. I've created apps to help companies manage sales flows with their sales and management teams, logistics automation and tracking, social networking and media companies, and passion projects for entrepreneurs across the planet. I've released custom mobile and tablet applications in the Construction, Healthcare, Logistitcs, and Financial spaces for over 7 years.

            <h2>Amazon AWS Server Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                I have jumped feet first in the wave of both containerless and single server creation and maintenance for active and large companies. Amazon Web Services is the primary cloud platform I work with. I have hands on Lambda <span class="italic">Functions As A Service</span> app development, Linux server creation and management, DNS and domain handling, scaling and general server maintenance and monitoring for a large number of clients. I currently have a <a href="https://www.handsomecathosting.com" title="Handsome Cat Hosting" target="_blank">boutique hosting company</a> for a hand full of businesses with clients I've built strong long term relationships with. The website you are looking at now is being served not from an actual server, but an Amazon S3 bucket - giving me super low cost and scalability that GoDaddy or other low-end and outdated server standards cannot offer. Heck - I'm even married to a Certified Amazon Solutions Architect, so you can say <span class="italic">servers run in the family</span>. I like to build custom servers, specialize in load balancing, and researching ongoing cost savings for servers and containers.

            <h2>WordPress Theme and Plugin Development</h2>
            <p>
                I have worked extensively with WordPress as a base CMS for my projects since it <span class="italic">literally first came out</span>, and have released over 300+ successful user experiences for brands across the Healthcare, Entertainment, Enterprise, and Financial sectors. I focus on super-custom WordPress themes and plugins to help companies increase automation, processes, and to leverage their site with better security practices. I still think it is the best CMS solution for a client, and comfortable with it for both large and Enterprise-level applications.

            <h2>PSD to HTML Development</h2>
            <p>
                I started out over 10 years ago, working directly with ad agencies on both coasts taking designs and turning them into <span class="strong">pixel perfect</span> html/css/sass frontend representations of .PSD mockups. I have an eye for design, and the ability to strive for perfection with chosen designs on the various number of platforms your audience are using. I also enjoy walking a client through a new site design process without chosen mockups, instead opting for <span class="italic">an orangic approach</span> to creating a stunning website.
